Open Source Licenses
  : Permissive Licenses and Copyleft Licenses 

Permissive Licenses 
  : Allows modification and distribution of software with few restrictions. This kind of license is more popular among companies that wishes to use the software commercially or to keep their software modifications *closed source*. Example: BSD and MIT licenses.
  
Source Avaiable Licenses (Not Open Source)
  : Despite that this type of license may look like an open source license as the the source code is available. Licenses of this kind may have many commercial use restrictions of the software, what makes this license not open source. Example: MongoDB no-SQL document database switched from AGPL to SSPL (Server Side Public License), which was introduced by MongoDB itself. 
  
Dual License Model
  : Software released, often under a copyleft license and a commerical license, which removes the restriction of the copyleft license. Example: Qt5.0 library by Qt Company, which is available under LGPL and commercial license allowing static linking by closed source software.
  
Open Core Model 
  : Software under open source license with other features closed source or paywalled.
  
Copyleft Linceses
  : Any version of modification of the software must be distributed under the same copyleft license. This license style is not favored by companies that need to keep their software modification proprietary.
