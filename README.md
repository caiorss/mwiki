# MWiki - Markdown-Powered Wiki 
## Overview 

MWiki is a **wiki engine** and note taking web application software geared towards mathematics and research designed for scientific and technical communication. This wiki engine software has semantic-rich lightweight markup language based on MyST markdown, Obsidian markdown, and Media wiki engine markup language. 

This Python application is powered by Python Flask web framework and the extensible markdown-it parser used by MyST markdown and the Jupyter Book project. 


+ Note: This software is still **work in progress** and under early stage. However, it can already be used as a personal note taking application.
+ Note: Mediawiki is the wiki engine software that powers Wikipedia.


**Features Highlights**

File-based Wiki 

+ All Wiki pages are stored as Markdown files like Moin Moin wiki engine and Dokuwiki. However, it uses SQLite file database or a any full-featured database for system management purposes. 

Wiki Features:  

 + Support MyST Markdown, GFM (Github-Flavored Markdown Support), subset of Obsidian Markdown syntax, subset of Mediawiki markup language and inline HTML.
 + Pages written in Markdown-based markup language instead of HTML, which allows to any non programmers to write scientific and technical documents that are rendered to html. 
 + Markdown **Code editor** built on top of Ace9 JavaScript code editor.
 + Supports pasting images from clipboard. 
     + Usage: Copy any image using the right click on any picture and past it on the text editor sesssion of some wiki page.
     + This feature relies on Web APIs, such as Clibpboard Html5 API, which only is available on [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). Therefore pasting images from clipboard to the wiki text editor only works when serving the page on local host or from a domain with https (HTTP + TLS), which may require a reverse proxy such as Caddy or NGinx for TLS/SSL termination of the network traffic.
 + Buttons for editing specific document sections similar to Media wiki section editing buttons. 
 + Embeddable pages. The contents of a wiki page can be embedded in another wiki page by using the syntax `![[Name of Wiki page to be embedded]]`
 + Vendored third-party JavaScript dependencies for offline usage. For instance, MWiki has MathJax, pseudocode-JS, and Ace9 in the source code for offline usage even when no CDN is available due to lack of internet connectivity or if the Wiki is used in rescrited environment behind a firewall. 

 Access control 

 + The wiki has the following types of users: *admin*, that can edit the Wiki pages; *guest* a registered used which can view pages even if the wiki is not public, but a guest user cannot edit any page; and *anonymous* users (non logged in users) that can only view pages if the **public** checkbox in the Wiki settings ('/settings' pages) is enabled.
 + Public/private wiki settings - if the **public** checkbox in MWiki settings page is disabled, only logged in users will be able to view the wiki pages and non logged in users will be redirected to the authentiation screen. If this checkbox is enabled, non logged in users can view the wiki. Note that: only users of type administrator can edit the wiki pages and make changes to any content.

## Installation using Pipx

**STEP 1:** Pip and Python are assumed to be already installed.

Install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) tool.

```sh
$ pip install pipx 
```

**STEP 2:** Install using Pipx

Install Mwiki using Pipx (MWiki requires Python >= 3.9)

```sh
$ pipx install git+https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki 
  installed package mwiki 0.1, installed using Python 3.9.19
  These apps are now globally available
    - mwiki
    - mwiki-convert
    - mwiki_convert
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨

```

Install Mwiki using  Pipx and a different version of Python. This command is useful if the default versuion of Python in the current system is 3.8 or a non supported version.

```
$ pipx install --python=3.9 git+https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki 
```

## Installation using Docker 

Docker is the most realibable way to install Python application since it is reproducible and helps to avoid the Python and Pip dependency hell (also knowns as "works-on-machine problem"). 

**STEP 1:** Clone the repository

```sh 
$ git clone https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki mwiki

# Enter source code directory
$ cd mwiki
```

**STEP 2:** Build the docker image.

```sh
$ docker build --tag mwiki-server .
```

**STEP 3:** Run MWiki docker image. The $WIKIPATH environment variable is set to any directory containing markdown files, including Obsidian vaults.

```sh
$ export WIKIPATH=/path/to/wiki/folder

$ docker run --rm -it  --network=host --volume="$WIKIPATH:/wiki" mwiki-server

```

Stop MWiki container:

```
$ docker stop mwiki 
mwiki
```

Start MWiki container 

```sh
$ docker start mwiki 
```

Restart MWiki container software.

```sh
$ docker restart mwiki
```

**STEP 5:** 

Open MWiki in the web browser, in the port 8080 by copying and pasting the URL http://localhost:8000 and enter 'admin' in the username entry and the initial admin password in the password field. The initial admin password is provided in the previous command output. In this password is '0JAJ6UAMUA', which is a random generated string unique per MWiki installation.

**STEP 6:**

Open the settings page http://localhost:8000/admin and change the Wiki settings. Then go the URL http://localhost:8000/user and change the admin password. Note that user passwords are never stored in plaintext, they are always stored in hashed form for security reasons.


## Development 

**STEP 1:** Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone <REPOSITORY-URL>  mwiki
$ cd mwiki
```

**STEP 2:** Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager if it is not installed yet.

```sh
$ pip install poetry 
```

**STEP 2:** Install dependencies with Poetry.

```sh
$ poetry install 
```

**STEP 3:** Generate VScode JSON files .vscode/settings.json and .vscode/launch.json for integrating Poetry, Virtualenv and VSCode editor.

```
$ make vscode
```

or run

```sh
$ pythopn vscode.py

## OR 

$ ./vscode.py # On Unix-like operating system (Linux, BSD or MacOSX)
```

**STEP 4:** Run MWiki in development mode.

```sh
 $ poetry run mwiki  server  --debug \
                              --host=0.0.0.0 \
                              --port=8000  \
                              --wikipath=/path/to/wiki-markdon-files/directory/notes
 [TRACE] Admin user created OK
 [INFO] Enter the username: admin and password: '0JAJ6UAMUA' to log in.
 * Serving Flask app 'mwiki.server'

```

The notes folder, in this case '/path/to/wiki-markdon-files/directory/notes', is just a folder containing markdown files and images. This folder can also be a *Obisdian Vault*, a repository of markdown files and images.

```sh
 $ ls notes/
'Android OS for Mobile Devices.md'
'APL - Programming Languages.md'
 articles/
'Authoring Tools.md'
 AWS_Cloud.md
 aws.org
'Backend Design and Scalability.md'
'Backup and Digital Preservation.md'
 Bookmarks.md
 books/
'Books and Files.md'
'Business News.md'
'Caching Algorithms and Synchronization.md'
'Collected Info.md'
'Command Line.md'
'Compiler Design.md'
'Computer Architecture.md'
   ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ...
   ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ...

```

Every markdown file is rendered as wiki page. For instance the file 'Business News.md' corresponds to the wiki page 

+ `http://<PAGE-DOMAIN>/wiki/Business%20News`

or

+ `http://localhost/wiki/Business%20News`


**STEP 5:** 

Open MWiki in the web browser, in the port 8080 by copying and pasting the URL http://localhost:8000 and enter 'admin' in the username entry and the initial admin password in the password field. The initial admin password is provided in the previous command output. In this password is '0JAJ6UAMUA', which is a random generated string unique per MWiki installation.

**STEP 6:**

Open the settings page http://localhost:8000/admin and change the Wiki settings. Then go the URL http://localhost:8000/user and change the admin password. Note that user passwords are never stored in plaintext, they are always stored in hashed form for security reasons.

Syntax:

```
![[image_file.png]]

Or 

![[relative/path/to/images/image_file_name.png]]
```

#### External Image 

Hyperlink to external image. The image URL can be a relative URL as shown in the example below or a URL of type `https://www.site.com/files/image.png `.

Syntax:

```
![$IMAGE-ALT-TEXT-DESCRIPTION]($IMAGE-URL)
```

Example:

```
![Java's Duke Mascot](/static/example_java_duke_mascot.svg)
```

Rendering: 

![Java's Duke Mascot](/static/example_java_duke_mascot.svg)


### Code Blocks 
#### Inline code 

Inline code must be surrounded by backtick character (\`).

Example:

```
+ The wiki syntax `<rfc:7231>` is rendered to a hyperlink to

        \end{bmatrix}
```

#### Latex Macros

It is possible to define LaTeX macros for writing math expressions in a more concise way
by using a code block similar to the example below on the top of the page. This special 
code block is not rendered, it is processed by MathJax or other LaTeX rendering engines.


````markdown
```{latex_macro}
% Logical AND 
\DeclareMathOperator{\\and}{ \\wedge }
% Logical OR
\DeclareMathOperator{\\or}{ \\vee }

 % ---- OR add your OWN LaTeX Macros here ------%%

```
````

After adding the previous macro to the top of the page, one can write logical expressions $\neg (p \wedge q)$, which means not (p and q) or NAND(p, q), in the following form:

```
$$
\neg (p \and q) \equiv \neg p \or q
$$
```


### Pseudocode of Algorithm

This wiki also supports LaTeX pseudocode of algorithms compatible with LaTeX algorithmic package. The implementation of this feature relies on [pseudocode-js](https://saswat.padhi.me/pseudocode.js/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) JavaScript libraries.

Example:

````latex
```{pseudo}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Buble Sort Algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\PROCEDURE{BubbleSort}{$A, n$}
   \STATE $B = $ \CALL{CopyArray}{$A, n$}
   \STATE $\:$ \textit{// i = 0, 1, ..., n - 1}
   \FOR{$i = 0$ \TO  $i < n$}
       \STATE $\:$ \textit{// j = 0, 1, ..., n - 2 }
       \FOR{$j = 0$ \TO $j < n - 1$}
           \IF{$B[j] > B[j+1]$}
               \STATE swap $B[j]$ with $B[j+1]$
           \ENDIF
       \ENDFOR

### MyST Roles 

The MyST Roles are similar to MyST directives, but they are single line. Exmaple:

Syntax:

```
{rolename}`text content here`
```

#### Abbreviation 

This syntax defines abbreviation of acronyms, that is rendered to an `<abbr>` html5 tag. The description of the acronym is shown in a popup window that appears when the user hoovers the mouse on the the abbreviation element.

Syntax:

```
 {abbr}`$ACRONYM  ($DESCRIPTION)`
```

Example:

```markdown
+ This wiki engine provides a syntax closer to {abbr}`MyST (Markedly Structured Text)`.
+ {abbr}`HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)` is a declarative language.
```

Rendering: 

+ This wiki engine provides a syntax closer to {abbr}`MyST (Markedly Structured Text)`.
+ {abbr}`HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)` is a declarative language.


#### Math Role for Inline LaTeX

```
+ The math expression  {math}`x^2 - 10x + 20` the previous function.
```

Rendering:

+ The math expression  {math}`x^2 - 10x + 20` the previous function.

####  Subscript  Role  

```
+ Water: H{sub}`2`O 
```

Rendering:

+ Water: H{sub}`2`O

#### Superscript Role 

Superscript Roles:

```
+ The 7{sup}`th` element.
```

Rendering:

+ The 7{sup}`th` element.


### Frontmatter (Page Metadata)

The frontmatter is a YAML section at the beginning of MWiki *.md page file within two triple dashes (---), which contains machine-readable metadata of the current wiki page, including, authors, tags, date, description, abbreviations, page settings and other data.


Example: consider the wiki page file

+ 'NAS - Network Attached Storage Device.md'

whose content is

```md
---
author:  John Doe
date:    2022-06-10
description: Survey of NAS - Network Attached Storage devices for reliable backup, data replication and file sharing.

---

Describe what is a NAS 

+ S.M.A.R.T monitoring of disks.
+ SMB file sharing - SAMBA implementation 

...

![[picture-of-synology-nas.png]]

```

#### Abbreviations

The frontmatter can be used for defining abbreviations of common words. Consider a wiki page whose the frontmatter is

```
---
author:      John Doe
date:        2022-06-10
description: Survey of NAS - Network Attached Storage devices for reliable backup, data replication and file sharing.
abbreviations:
   NAS:  Network Attached Storage Device
   RAID: Redudant Array of Inexpensive Disks
   NFS:  Network File System 
   SMB:  Server Message Block (Windows shares, also known as network shares)
---
```

Any word defined in the 'abbreviations' section of a YAML frontmatter of a particular wiki page file, it is replaced by the `<abbr>` html5 element. 

For instance if a text of this wiki page is 

```
Most NAS devides provide Web UI for quickly 
creating SMB network shares, windows shared folders.
```

Then, it will be rendered to html as 

```html
Most <abbr title="Network Attached Storage Device">NAS</abbr>  
devides provide Web UI for quickly creating 
<abbr title="Server Message Block">SMB</abbr> network shares, 
windows shared folders.
```

When the mouse is over any abbr text, which has black dashes below it, a pop up window is appears displaying the meaning of the abbreviation. This feature also works on mobile devices, including phones and tablets.

#### Wordlinks

The wordlinks feature allows quickly creating hyperlinks for words defined in the **wordlinks** section of a frontmatter of a wiki page. This feature is useful for creating hyperlinks to dictionry definitions or Wikipedia articles related to a particular word. For instance consider the following frontmatter of a Wiki page *.md file.


```md
---
description: Wiki page (note) description here.

abbreviations:
    GUI: Graphics User Interface

wordlinks:
   ZFS:      https://hyperlink-to-wikipedia-of-ZFS
   TrueNAS:  https://link-to-wikipedia-of-TrueNAS

---
```

Whenever the word ZFS appears in any MWiki, paragraph, quote or bullet list, it is replaced by a hyperlink whose label is the word 'ZFS' and the URL is the corresponding URL to this word defined wordlist YAML dictionary. 

For instance, the wiki text 

```md
The file system ZFS is awesome!
```

is rendered to HTML as 

```html
The file system
<a href=" https://hyperlink-to-wikipedia-of-ZFS" ...>ZFS</a>
is awesome.
```

The advantage of this feature allows users to turn words of a MWiki page into hyperlinks without modifying the text or defining the hyperlink multiple times as 

+  `[word](http://hyperlink-of-this-word)`
