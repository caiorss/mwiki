# MWiki - Markdown-Powered Wiki 

## Overview 

MWiki is a **wiki engine** and note taking web application software geared towards mathematics and research designed for scientific and technical communication. This wiki engine software has semantic-rich lightweight markup language based on MyST markdown, Obsidian markdown, and Media wiki engine markup language. 

This Python application is powered by Python Flask web framework and the extensible markdown-it parser used by MyST markdown and the Jupyter Book project. 

Applications:
+ Documentation 
+ Technical/Scientific Writing, specially STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields.
+ Personal Knowledge Base
+ Knowledge and Information Preservation 


NOTES: 

+ Note: This software is still **work in progress** and under early stage. However, it can already be used as a personal note taking application.
+ Note: Mediawiki is the wiki engine software that powers Wikipedia.

### Features Highlights

#### Wiki Features 

+ File-based Wiki: all Wiki pages are stored as Markdown files like Moin Moin wiki engine and Dokuwiki. However, it uses SQLite file database or a any full-featured database for system management purposes. 
 + Supports MyST Markdown, GFM (Github-Flavored Markdown Support), subset of Obsidian Markdown syntax, subset of Mediawiki markup language and inline HTML.
 + Pages written in Markdown-based markup language instead of HTML, which allows to any non programmers to write scientific and technical documents that are rendered to html. 
 + Buttons for editing specific document sections similar to Media wiki section editing buttons. 
 + File upload. Now the wiki code editor has a button for inserting a hyperlink to an uploaded file. When the button is clicked, a popup window for upload is shown. Once the user sends the file, the window is closed and a link to the file is inserted in the editor.
 + Embeddable pages. The contents of a wiki page can be embedded in another wiki page by using the syntax `![[Name of Wiki page to be embedded]]`
 + Document preview - allows users viewing how a wiki page markdown text will look like when rendered before saving it. The editor's preview button also allows viewing how a selected markdown code of a wiki page looks like when rendered.
 + Vendored third-party JavaScript dependencies for offline usage. For instance, MWiki has MathJax, pseudocode-JS, and Ace9 in the source code for offline usage even when no CDN is available due to lack of internet connectivity or if the Wiki is used in rescrited environment behind a firewall. 


#### Access control 

 + The wiki has the following types of users: *admin*, that can edit the Wiki pages; *guest* a registered used which can view pages even if the wiki is not public, but a guest user cannot edit any page; and *anonymous* users (non logged in users) that can only view pages if the **public** checkbox in the Wiki settings ('/settings' pages) is enabled.
 + Public/private wiki settings - if the **public** checkbox in MWiki settings page is disabled, only logged in users will be able to view the wiki pages and non logged in users will be redirected to the authentiation screen. If this checkbox is enabled, non logged in users can view the wiki. Note that: only users of type administrator can edit the wiki pages and make changes to any content.


#### Text Editor Features

+ Markdown **Code editor** built on top of Ace9 JavaScript code editor.
+ *Clipboard to markdown converter*, which allows turning html content copied from any other web page (aka web site) to MWiki markdown. This feature is similar to Obsidian's non-plain text copying and pasting. 
+ Upload images by pasting them from clipboard. 
     + Usage: Copy any image using the right click on any picture and past it on the text editor sesssion of some wiki page either by using the mouse or typing Ctrl + v.
+ NOTE: The clipboard features rely on Clibpboard Html5 API, which only is available on [secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). Therefore pasting images from clipboard to the wiki text editor only works if the wiki is served on local host or from a domain with https (HTTP + TLS), which may require a reverse proxy such as Caddy or NGinx for TLS/SSL encryption and server authentication.
+ [VIM](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>) Editor Keybindings: The Wiki editor uses VIM keybindings by default.

```


### Installation using Pipx pacakge manager 

**STEP 1:** Pip and Python are assumed to be already installed.

Install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) tool.

```sh
$ pip install pipx 
```

**STEP 2:** Install using Pipx

Install Mwiki using Pipx (MWiki requires Python >= 3.9)

```sh
$ pipx install git+https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki 
  installed package mwiki 0.1, installed using Python 3.9.19
  These apps are now globally available
    - mwiki
    - mwiki-convert
    - mwiki_convert
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨

```

Install Mwiki using Pipx and a different version of Python. This command is useful if the default version of Python in the current system is 3.8 or a non supported version.

```
$ pipx install --python=3.9 git+https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki 
```

### Installation using Docker 

Docker is the most realibable way to install Python application since it is reproducible and helps to avoid the Python and Pip dependency hell (also knowns as "works-on-machine problem"). 

**STEP 1:** Clone the repository

```sh 
$ git clone https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki mwiki

# Enter source code directory
$ cd mwiki
```

**STEP 2:** Build the docker image.

```sh
$ docker build --tag mwiki-server .
```

or run the Makefile (only supported on Unix-like systems with GNU Make)

```sh
$ make docker 
```

**STEP 3:** Run MWiki docker image. The $WIKIPATH environment variable is set to any directory containing markdown files, including Obsidian vaults.

Create a .env file in the current directory containing the initial configuration of MWiki passed as environment variables. (Optional)


File: .env

```
MWIKI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=u2afb5ck69
MWIKI_SITENAME=WBook
WIKI_PUBLIC=
```

Run docker passing the .env configuration file.

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it  --privileged \
            --network=host --env-file=$PWD/.env \
            --volume="$WIKIPATH:/wiki" mwiki-server

```

Stop MWiki container:

```
$ docker stop mwiki 
mwiki
```

Start MWiki container 

```sh
$ docker start mwiki 
```

Restart MWiki container software.

```sh
$ docker restart mwiki
```

Change site name using the built-in CLI (Command Line Interface)


```sh
$ docker exec -it mwiki python -m mwiki  manage --sitename=WNotes
 [*] Site name changed to: WNotes
```

Change admin password.

```sh
$ docker exec -it mwiki python -m mwiki  manage --admin-password=somePassNewPassword
```

**STEP 5:** 

Open MWiki in the web browser, in the port 8080 by copying and pasting the URL http://localhost:8000 and enter 'admin' in the username entry and the initial admin password in the password field. The initial admin password is provided in the previous command output. In this password is '0JAJ6UAMUA', which is a random generated string unique per MWiki installation.

**STEP 6:**

Open the settings page http://localhost:8000/admin and change the Wiki settings. Then go the URL http://localhost:8000/user and change the admin password. Note that user passwords are never stored in plaintext, they are always stored in hashed form for security reasons.


### Installation via Docker-Compose or Podman-Compose 


**STEP 1:** Clone the repository

```sh 
$ git clone https://github.com/caiorss/mwiki mwiki

# Enter source code directory
$ cd mwiki
```

If the repository is already cloned, it is possible to get the latest changes by running

```
$ git pull
```

**STEP 2:** Switch to a stable release

```sh
$ git checkout <<RELASE-VERSION>>

# For instance

$ git checkout v0.31
```

**STEP 3:** Edit the config.env file.

File: config.env

```sh
# MWiki configuration files 
#----------------------------------#

MWIKI_SERVER_ADDR=mwiki 
MWIKI_SERVER_PORT=9090

# Path to wiki folder, where *.md markdown files, images and other 
# files will be stored.
MWIKI_PATH=./sample-wiki

# Password of main admin
MWIKI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=mypasswd

# Name of the Wiki (Name of the website)
MWIKI_SITENAME=MyNoteBook

# URL which the website is hosted or just domain name 
MWIKI_WEBSITE=localhost sbox.ts 

# Configure MWiki as a private Wiki. 
# => Only logged in users can view wiki pages. 
# MWIKI_PUBLIC=   

# Configure MWiki  as a public Wiki.
# => Anonymous users can view wiki pages, however only 
# admin users can edit.
MWIKI_PUBLIC=true

# Server static files using Caddy or NGinx 
MWIKI_X_ACCEL_REDIRECT=true

#----------------------------------------------------##
##      Less common Settings for certificate         ##
#----------------------------------------------------##
# They are not needed if the server is hosted in a machine
# with static and public IP address. Those settings are only
# required when hosting in internal networks (LANs).
#
MWIKI_INTERNAL_CA=
MWIKI_ACME_CA_URL=
```


**STEP 4:** Run docker-compose or podman compose for the deployment.

Deploy with docker-compose.

```sh
$ docker-compose --env-file=./config.env up -d 
```

Deploy with podman-compose.

```sh
$ podman-compose --env-file=./config.env up -d 
```

**STEP 5:** TLS/SSL Certificates

If the MWiki is hosted in a machine with static and public IP address reacheable from anywhere on the internet and MWiki domain points to this IP address, Caddy will automatically obtain the TLS/SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt CA - Certificate authority. 

If this application is hosted on local network or site-to-site VPN, such as tailscale and using Let's Encrypt CA is not possible, Caddy can be turned into a local CA - Certificate Authority by editing the config.env and changing 

```
MWIKI_INTERNAL_CA=true
```

This step creates an endpoint 

+ `https://<mwiki-website-domain>/root.crt`

where the user can download the root CA certificate and install it on web browsers or phones. This root CA cerfiticate can be downloaded using curl. This procedure is useful for self-hosting MWiki on home labs.

```sh
$ curl -O -k --silent https://<mwiki-website-domain>/root.crt
```

## Post-Installation 

### Access MWiki in the local network

**STEP 1:** 

Get the hostname of the computer where mDNS is installed on Linux, MacOSX or Windows by running the following command in a terminal emulator. In Microsft Windows, a terminal emulator can be opened by typing Windows-Key + R and entering 'cmd'.

```sh
$ hostname 
```

and also get the computer IP address on Microsoft Windows for debugging purposes.

```sh
$ ipconfig
```

on Linux the IP address of the server in the local network can be obtained by running.

```sh
# Older versions of Linux distributions, BSD and MacOSX
$ ifconfig

## Newer version of Linux distributions
$ ip addr
```

**STEP 2:** 

If the MWiki server is installed and running and it is possible to access the server from any computer in the local network with mDSN - Multicast DNS enabled by opening the one the of the following URLs in any web browser from any device or computer in the local network, including smart phones or tablets. 

+ http://dummy.local:8080 if MWiki is listening to TCP port 8080
+ http://dummy.local  if MWiki is listening to port 80 (default HTTP TCP port)
+ http://192.168.0.106:8080 if the server IP address obtained in the step 1 is 192.168.0.106 and MWiki is listening to port 8080
+ http://192.168.0.106 if the server IP address obtained in the step 1 is 192.168.0.106 and MWiki is listening to port 80.

Observations:

1. Note that *dummy* is the hostname (network name) of the computer running MWiki obtained in the step 1 with the command `$ hostname`.
2. In most corporate network, the multicast network traffic is disabled by default, while in most home networks the multicast network traffic, including multicast DNS is enabled by default. 

MWiki can be started with the command

```
$ mwiki server  --wsgi --port=9010 --wikipath=/home/user/path/to/wiki/repository
```

It is recommend to run the application using Caddy or NGinx reverse proxy servers as they provide TLS encryption and better performance for serving static files and handling higher network traffic.

### Open Firewall Ports

**STEP 3:**

In order to be able to access MWiki or any other web server from other computers or devices, it may be necessary to open TCP ports in the operating system firewall.

Open port 8080 in Microsoft Windows (requires opening a terminal with administrator privilegees).

```sh
$ netsh firewall add portopening TCP 8080 "MWIki server port"
```

Open port 8080 in Linux with Iptables (Default Linux firewall, all other Linux firewalls are wrappers around Iptables).

```sh
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
```

Open port 8080 in Linux with UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), mostly used by Debian and Ubuntu derived Linux distributions.

```sh
$ sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
```

Open port 8080 in Linux with firewalld.

```sh
$ sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### SSH Port Forwarding

The feature for pasting images from clipboard requires a browser's secure context, which can be obtained by running the MWiki server using a TLS (Transport Layer Security) reverse proxy such as Caddy or running it on localhost. An alternative way to obtain a secure context without dealing with NGinx or Caddy installation is using SSH local port fowarding for redirecting the network traffic of local TCP port to TCP port of a remote machine, any computer with an ssh server installed. For instance, if MWiki is running a remote machine whose hostname is dummy.local (Local network IPv4 address 192.168.0.115) listening the TCP port 9090, it is possible to redirect the network traffic from local port 8080 to the port 9090 of the dummy machine with the ssh command

```sh
$ ssh  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  -v -f -N -L  8080:127.0.0.1:9090  myuser@dummy.local
```

or

```sh
$ ssh  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no  -v -f -N -L  8080:127.0.0.1:9090  myuser@dummy.local -p 2022
```

Where:
+ `-v` 
  - It means verbose for better error diagnosing.
+ `-f` means running ssh in background without blocking the current terminal emulator.
+ `-N` 
  - It means non-interactive session for port forwarding only.
+ `-L  8080:127.0.0.1:9090`
  - Local port forwarding of TCP port 8080 of current machine to port 9090 of the remote machine.
+ `o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` 
  - The purpose of this command line option is to ignore strict host checking (optional).
+ `-p 2022`
  - Use ssh port 2022 instad of default ssh port 222.

After running this command, it will be possible to access the MWiki server by opening the any of the following URLs in any web browser, inclding Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and etc.


+ http://localhost:8080

or

+ http://127.0.0.1:8080


The advantage of this approach is allowing access to the Wiki server even if it is not exposed to the internet and all TCP ports are blocked by any firewall application. This procedure is also helpful for providing [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), which allows using the [clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API) APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) of web browsers without dealing with TLS (Transport Layer Security), former SSL (Secure Socket Layer), certificates. Note that the network traffic between the remote machine and local machine is encrypted by SSH. It is also worth mentioning that a built-in SSH client is available in Microsoft Windows 10 and Microsft Windows 11.

Note that the SSH hostname myuser@dummy.local could also be:

1. Domain name for instance, my-dummy-machine.net, if this hypothetical domain points the dummy machine public Ipv4 address. 
2. mDNS (Multi-cast DNS) domain name. Example: dummy.local if the machine hostname is dummy and the local network allows multi-cast DNS. Most home networks allow multicast DNS, however it is disabled in most corporate networks.
3. Tailscale (Site-To-Site) VPN magic DNS domain name. 
4. External Ipv4 address, for instance 172.168.115.125 if the MWiki is running in any machine with public (fixed/static) IPv4 adress, often cloud VPS - Virtual Private Server virtual machine. All VPS (Virtual Private Server), cloud virtual machines, provided by Google Cloud, AWS, Digital Ocean and other cloud providers have public IPv4 address reacheable from anywhere around the world.
5. Internal Ipv4 for accessing in the local network, for instance 192.168.0.115

## Development 

**STEP 1:** Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone <REPOSITORY-URL>  mwiki
$ cd mwiki
```

**STEP 2:** Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager if it is not installed yet.

```sh
$ pip install poetry 
```

**STEP 2:** Install dependencies with Poetry.

```sh
$ poetry install 
```

**STEP 3:** Generate VScode JSON files .vscode/settings.json and .vscode/launch.json for integrating Poetry, Virtualenv and VSCode editor.

```
$ make vscode
```

or run

```sh
$ pythopn vscode.py

## OR 

$ ./vscode.py # On Unix-like operating system (Linux, BSD or MacOSX)
```

**STEP 4:** Run MWiki in development mode.

```sh
 $ poetry run mwiki  server  --debug \
                              --host=0.0.0.0 \
                              --port=8000  \
                              --wikipath=/path/to/wiki-markdon-files/directory/notes
 [TRACE] Admin user created OK
 [INFO] Enter the username: admin and password: '0JAJ6UAMUA' to log in.
 * Serving Flask app 'mwiki.server'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)

```

The notes folder, in this case '/path/to/wiki-markdon-files/directory/notes', is just a folder containing markdown files and images. This folder can also be a *Obisdian Vault*, a repository of markdown files and images.

```sh
 $ ls notes/
'Android OS for Mobile Devices.md'
'APL - Programming Languages.md'
 articles/
'Authoring Tools.md'
 AWS_Cloud.md
 aws.org
'Backend Design and Scalability.md'
'Backup and Digital Preservation.md'
 Bookmarks.md
 books/
'Books and Files.md'
'Business News.md'
'Caching Algorithms and Synchronization.md'
'Collected Info.md'
'Command Line.md'
'Compiler Design.md'
'Computer Architecture.md'
   ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ...
   ... ... ...  ... ... ... ... ...

```

Every markdown file is rendered as wiki page. For instance the file 'Business News.md' corresponds to the wiki page 

+ `http://<PAGE-DOMAIN>/wiki/Business%20News`

or

+ `http://localhost/wiki/Business%20News`


**STEP 5:** 

Open MWiki in the web browser, in the port 8080 by copying and pasting the URL http://localhost:8000 and enter 'admin' in the username entry and the initial admin password in the password field. The initial admin password is provided in the previous command output. In this password is '0JAJ6UAMUA', which is a random generated string unique per MWiki installation.

**STEP 6:**

Open the settings page http://localhost:8000/admin and change the Wiki settings. Then go the URL http://localhost:8000/user and change the admin password. Note that user passwords are never stored in plaintext, they are always stored in hashed form for security reasons.

+ *Allow Right Click - Re-enable right-click on websites that overwrite it* (Firefox)
  + https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/re-enable-right-click/
  + *The "Allow Right-Click" extension modifies some JavaScript methods to enable the original right-click context menu when a web page intentionally blocks right-clicking on its content. Most modern browsers permit JavaScript to disable the default context menu when a web page provides its custom context menu for its content (such as in Google Docs). However, this ability can also allow website owners to disable the right-click context menu without providing any useful functionality. The extension adds a button to the toolbar area of the user's browser. Clicking the extension's icon injects a small script into the current page to remove the context menu blockage. It is important to note that the extension does not inject any code by default on any web page; it only does so on user action. Users can click the extension button to release the restriction when a website blocks the right-click context menu without offering a custom context menu.*

Text and voice processing take place entirely offline, locally on your computer, without using a network connection. Your privacy is always respected. No data is sent to the Internet.*
  + WARNING: Automated text translation tools are based on word probability in the same way as the hyped LLM - Large Laguage Models. As a result, they may not be able to accurately translate slangs, jargons, popular sayings and language nuances. Moreover, they are more likely to fail for languages distant from European languages and English. It is also worth noting that some language varieties or dialects, such as the Bavarian German dialect, might exist mostly in spoken form and unfortunately, not exist in significant amount in written form, what makes it harder to automated tools to translate the information.

  + *What if you could host a web service with no ports exposed? With Cloudflare Tunnel, you can!*
  + COMMENT: For people who does not trust Cloudflare, a self-hosted Tailscale mesh VPN is a better choice. Tailscale allows establishing a direct end-to-end encrypted tunnel between tailscale client nodes (machines with tailscale client installed). As a result, any node in a taiscale network can access any web service exposed by other tailscale nodes. For instance, if an Android or Iphone has a taiscale client app installed. It is possible to browse a websiste hostead in the local network, possibly behding a NAT - Network Address Translator which blocks incoming connections by default, by opeing the URL http://dummy:8080 or http://dummy.net.ts:8080, where dummy is the hostname or tailscale name of the computer that hosts the web server. Tailscale is not only useful for accessing local web servers from anywhere without exposing any TCP or UDP port to the internet, it is also helpful for accessing windows shared forlders (SAMBA/SMB), sometimes called Windows shares, and Windows Machines remotely through VNC or remote desktop. 
  + COMMENT: Exposing a local web server to the internet with Taiscale requires installing a tailscale client in the local computer hosting the web server and a tailscale client in the VPS - Virtual Private Server, a virtual machine, hosted on the cloud with public IP address. All it is need is to add a configuration to caddy or nging in the remote machine to forward the network traffic of ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) to the tailscale IP addres or hostname of the local computer, for instance dummy.net.ts is the hostanme or tailscale name of the local computer is dummy. The role of a tailscale server, that must be installed in machine with static and public IP address, is only coordinating connections between clients. Once a connection from client-to-client has been established, the network traffic between clients does not goes thorugh the server.
